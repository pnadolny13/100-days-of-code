# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Installed visual studio, researched difference between java applet/servlet/application…it seems like JavaScript replaces applets. I then played around with the basic greeting rest API.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with understanding how to run a rest api outside of eclipse, had to package as a fat jar but still had issues running it as a standalone.

### Day 1: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Researched Rest APIs and when you would use them vs frameworks. Angular.js is a front end client-side development tool that can ping a Rest API for backend stuff while Node.js is a server-side Javascript framework/language. 
I had trouble getting my main to run in the rest service because I moved it to a new directory. Tried updating it to receive bill split info but wasn’t able to test. Instead jumped to Python and wrote a basic calculator that accepts user input to split a bill.


**Thoughts**: I had trouble figuring out what to work on, everything seems like a bigger project and requires research. I need to get out of the mind set of pushing code every day and into the set of research and starting somewhere, not pushing bad code.

### Day 2: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Researched and started a simple Flask app that was Hello world but now can collect email addresses and display them. Transfered log file to github for simplicity. (http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/core/data.html)

**Thoughts** Flask is much easier than Django. I would like to create app for inputing these log files so I dont have to come in here every night and manually edit it.

### Day 3: January 05, 2018
 
**Today's Progress**: I updated the Flask form to accept inputs for my 100 days of code log file. It then update the log file in the appropriate format so I can just push to GitHub. I will probably have to limit it so that it restricts me more because I dont want to submit twice in a day.
 
**Thoughts** I think this is cool but I will probably have to make it look better and do more validation. Today is a Friday and I got home at 630 so its tough to sit down and code...almost skipped a day but resisted
