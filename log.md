# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Installed visual studio, researched difference between java applet/servlet/application…it seems like JavaScript replaces applets. I then played around with the basic greeting rest API.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with understanding how to run a rest api outside of eclipse, had to package as a fat jar but still had issues running it as a standalone.

### Day 1: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Researched Rest APIs and when you would use them vs frameworks. Angular.js is a front end client-side development tool that can ping a Rest API for backend stuff while Node.js is a server-side Javascript framework/language. 
I had trouble getting my main to run in the rest service because I moved it to a new directory. Tried updating it to receive bill split info but wasn’t able to test. Instead jumped to Python and wrote a basic calculator that accepts user input to split a bill.


**Thoughts**: I had trouble figuring out what to work on, everything seems like a bigger project and requires research. I need to get out of the mind set of pushing code every day and into the set of research and starting somewhere, not pushing bad code.

### Day 2: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Researched and started a simple Flask app that was Hello world but now can collect email addresses and display them. Transfered log file to github for simplicity. (http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/core/data.html)

**Thoughts** Flask is much easier than Django. I would like to create app for inputing these log files so I dont have to come in here every night and manually edit it.

### Day 3: January 05, 2018
 
**Today's Progress**: I updated the Flask form to accept inputs for my 100 days of code log file. It then update the log file in the appropriate format so I can just push to GitHub. I will probably have to limit it so that it restricts me more because I dont want to submit twice in a day.
 
**Thoughts** I think this is cool but I will probably have to make it look better and do more validation. Today is a Friday and I got home at 630 so its tough to sit down and code...almost skipped a day but resisted

### Day 4: January 06, 2018
 
**Today's Progress**: I updated the 100 days flask app to throw a warning if the day already exists so that I dont have duplicate days. It can be done better but the hack worked. 
 
**Thoughts** Nothing today...not a lot of time to work on this.
 
**Link(s) to work:** NA


### Day 5: January 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent far over 1 hr but I updated the Flask log app with page for viewing full log file, a home page with radio buttons to select an action, a delete today's post button in case it needs to be updated, input page notification for which was the most recent post, removed manual day input so users doesnt mess it up by accident.

**Thoughts** My app is a mess right now because its in one script file with global and local variables mixed around very unorganized. I need to spend time refactoring to make variables more clear. Also debugging in Spyder/Python is different than Eclipse/Java so I need to spend time getting used to it.

### Day 6: January 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I refactored the app to be a little bit more organized. Still all in one app.py so its not totally organized but its a start. I also learned about Flask-Bootstrap to make some of the FE design stuff easier. I implemented a simple nav bar that move around the app easily. Still need to update the content to look better.

**Thoughts** I missed two days because I had a pipe burst and will have to manually update this date. To make up for it, I spent an extra hour today on 1/10 to make up for 1/9...so I'm logging this for 1/9.

### Day 7: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I didnt get a lot done. I spent a long line trying to get a bootstrap template to work. It did but it was only a one pager so it wasnt going to work. Bootstrap is easy until you have to customize it. Rolled back to old code. I researched github integration and their wasnt too much, sounds like it might be tough.

**Thoughts** I had an idea that I could use the bootstrap template to showcase all of the things I do during the 100 days of coding. I could update as I finish projects and write a little description with links to github.
